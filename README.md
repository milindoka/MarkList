# MarkList
A Fully Automatic System To Keep Progress Record Of Students

This project is a group of small java applications, one Android Application and a php script for web site. 
These utilities create,maintains and display these records on website and ultimately print progress cards in the end of academic year
Teachers use an android app to record students progress in individual subjects lists and send them to a process department in the institution via email, telegram or any other means of file sharing.

The associated Desktop apps can print these records in tabulated form. The compiler program MRKcollector
makes a compilation of the data and also gives mySql database for school website.
This system is specially designed for Indian School Curriculum and especially in the state of Maharashtra.
The project is implemented in my own school/college and to be adopted in about 10 schools and colleges in Mumbai, India.
The android app is available at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.refort.MarkList&hl=en (which is for numeric roll)
I am uploading Alpha-Numeric Version to FDroid for the institutions that use Alpha-Numeric Rolls (IDs)  for Students.

Source for Numeric-Version is uploaded at https://sourceforge.net/projects/marklist/

I hope it will be useful to other schools and colleges in the State.
