# MarkList
A Fully Automatic System To Keep Progress Record Of Students

This project is a group of small java applications and one Android Application.
These utilities create,maintains and display these records on website and ultimately print progress cards
in the end of academic year
Teachers use android app to record students progress in individual subjects lists and send them to a process department in
the institution via email, telegram or any other means of file sharing.

The associated Desktop apps can print these records in tabulated form for phyical record.
(Desktop Apps are available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/marklist/ ).

The compilation program MRKcollector
makes a compilation of the data and also gives mySql database for school website display of records.

This system is specially designed for Indian High School Curriculum in the state of Maharashtra.
The project is implemented in my own school/college and to be adopted in about 10 schools and colleges in Mumbai, India.
The android app is available at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.refort.MarkList&hl=en (which is for numeric roll/ID)
I am uploading Alpha-Numeric Version to F-Droid for the institutions that use Alpha-Numeric Rolls (IDs)  for Students.

Source for Numeric-Version is uploaded at https://sourceforge.net/projects/marklist/

I hope it will be useful to other schools and colleges in the State or possibly to any school with
appropriate modification in the source.
